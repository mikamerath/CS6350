# Ensemble Learning
My implementation of ID3 is very slow so I can only use T up to 15. T is set to T=10 to show that 
the algorithms work.

## Adaboost (not finished)
Navigate to the `EnsembleLearning` directory and simply run `python adaboost.py`

## Bagging
Navigate to the `EnsembleLearning` directory and simply run `python bagging.py`

## Random Forest
Navigate to the `EnsembleLearning` directory and simply run `python random_forest.py`

## Results
Results for each type of ensemble learning are available in the `results` subdirectory
